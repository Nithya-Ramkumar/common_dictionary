# =============================================================================
# GENERIC OUTPUT ENTITY SCHEMA TEMPLATE (DOMAIN-AGNOSTIC)
# =============================================================================
# This config defines output schemas for extracted entities for ANY domain.
# Each schema specifies which fields (attributes, metadata, etc.) to include in output files (JSON, CSV, TSV), and their order.
# You can define multiple schemas (e.g., default, summary, detailed) for different reporting or export needs.
#
# How to use:
#   - Copy this template to your config directory and modify as needed for your environment or test config.
#   - To add a new field, add its name to the list. To remove, delete it. To change order, rearrange the list.
#   - Fields should match the attributes defined in your entity_config, plus any additional metadata (id, provenance, etc.).
#   - You can add as many schemas as you want. The extractor will use the one specified in your config, or 'default' if not specified.
#
# SCHEMA TYPES:
#   - default: The standard output schema for most use cases. Includes all key fields for each entity.
#   - summary: A minimal schema for quick overviews or dashboards. Typically includes only identifiers and a few key attributes.
#   - detailed: A comprehensive schema for in-depth analysis or auditing. Includes all available fields, including provenance and confidence.
#
# Example (generic, for any domain):
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
output_schemas:
  default:
    - id            # Unique identifier for the entity (e.g., database ID, accession number)
    - name          # Name or label of the entity
    - property1     # Example attribute (replace with your domain's attribute)
    - property2     # Example attribute (replace with your domain's attribute)
    - provenance    # Provenance info (source, endpoint, etc.)
    - confidence    # Extraction confidence score (if available)
    - timestamp     # Extraction timestamp for each record (recommended for provenance)
  summary:
    - id
    - name
    - property1
    - timestamp     # Extraction timestamp (optional)
  detailed:
    - id
    - name
    - property1
    - property2
    - property3     # Add as many attributes as needed
    - provenance
    - confidence
    - timestamp     # Extraction timestamp for each record
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# To customize for your domain, replace 'property1', 'property2', etc. with the actual attribute names from your entity_config.
# You may also add or remove schemas as needed for your reporting requirements.

# EXAMPLE: OUTPUT SCHEMA FOR A HYPOTHETICAL 'materials' DOMAIN
# =============================================================================
# This example shows how to fill out the output_schemas section for a domain with entities like Material, Alloy, and Polymer.
# Replace 'property1', 'property2', etc. with actual attribute names from your entity_config.
#
# materials:
#   output_schemas:
#     default:
#       - id
#       - name
#       - composition
#       - density
#       - provenance
#       - confidence
#       - timestamp
#     summary:
#       - id
#       - name
#       - composition
#       - timestamp
#     detailed:
